# Instructions for maintenance

## Adding new temples: 

### in res folder:
1. add new temple to the end of temple_names.txt in res/raw. If adding multiple, add them in the order announced. Follow the format of the other temple names in the file. Copy the new temples into res/raw-en and res/raw-zh as well.

2. add a text file for each temple into each of these three folders: raw, raw-en, and raw-zh. Name each file following the naming convention used in the templenames.txt, and add the .txt extension. If you're using Linux, I recommend the "touch" command, which will let you create all your files at once in each folder.

3. Fill the new text files with relevant information, like any announcement, groundbreaking, or dedication dates. Follow the format found in existing temple files.

### in res/drawable folder:
add new temple webp images in drawable: <br/>
    1. small: 200x200 <br/>
    2. large: 500x500 <br/>
Images should be cropped into circles.

### in TempleView.java:
in TempleView.java, adjust field howManyTemples to the number of total temples. This will be equal to the number of lines in temple_names.txt

UPDATE ---> This should no longer be necessary through the implementation of the countTemples function. The number of temples should be retrieved by itself from the temple_names.txt file in raw
